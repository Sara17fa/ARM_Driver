# ARM_Driver
In this project, Iwill develop drivers for the SysTick timer and the Nested Vectored Interrupt  Controller (NVIC) on the TM4C series microcontrollers.
 The project aims to provide hands-on 
experience with embedded systems programming, specifically focusing on system timers and 
interrupt management. I will configure the system to run at a clock speed of 16MHz.
